  "description": "Superchat is, basically, a series of chat rooms—only it must also be super. It's super-ness will be conveyed primarily through its live-updating interface, built upon a Redis store. Its super-ness might also exhibit itself vis à vis its aesthetics (though some may dismiss these efforts as superficial).",

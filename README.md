### Project Description:    
Superchat is a series of chat rooms with a live-updating interface (using WebSockets), built upon a Redis store.    
It has a user login page (very basic with no password).    
It then takes user to the home page where user can post messages to a chatroom.     
To add or switch rooms, user can click on link and that takes you to a page where you can do so.     
It also shows number of users in each chatroom.     
User can logout anytime
